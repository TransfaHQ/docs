## Decision Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess your requirements">
    Consider:
    - **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements for data location
    - **Team Skills**: DevOps and infrastructure expertise
    - **Scale**: Expected transaction volumes
    - **Budget**: Infrastructure vs. managed service costs
    - **Control**: Need for customization vs. convenience
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluate deployment models">
    - **Self-hosted** if you need maximum control and customization
    - **Managed cloud** if you want zero operations overhead
    - **Hybrid** if you have specific compliance or architectural needs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start with self-hosted">
    Begin with a self-hosted deployment to:
    - Understand the system architecture
    - Test with your workload
    - Evaluate operational requirements
    - Make an informed decision about managed services
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Most organizations start with self-hosted deployment to understand operational requirements, then migrate to managed cloud as they scale.
