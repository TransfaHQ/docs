## Overview

The Transfa API is a REST API that provides complete control over your financial ledger infrastructure. Built on TigerBeetle, it enables high-performance double-entry bookkeeping with support for 100,000+ transactions per second.

All API endpoints use JSON for requests and responses, follow RESTful conventions, and are versioned at `/v1/`.
